# CA296-Assembly
My programs for the DCU CASE module about Assembly Level Programming

The Microprocessor Simulator for Students [http://www.softwareforeducation.com/sms32v50/] was used to create and test these programs.

Most programs will be from lab questions set by the lecturer Donal FitzPatrick. I may put in some extra programs not relating to the course, these will be highlighted.
